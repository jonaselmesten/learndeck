A centrifuge is a piece of equipment that puts an object in rotation around a fixed axis, applying a force perpendicular to the axis of spin that can be very strong."}]},{"cardId":170,"difficulty":1.0,"cardComponents":[{"textArea":"Nuclear sizes are expressed in a unit named\n\nA) Fermi\tB) Angstrom\nC) Newton\tD) Tesla"},{"separator":1920},{"textArea":" A) Fermi\n\nNuclear sizes are expressed in a unit called \"Fermi\" which is a unit of length equal to 10âˆ’15 metre (one femtometre), used in nuclear physics. It is similar to the diameter of a proton."}]},{"cardId":171,"difficulty":1.0,"cardComponents":[{"textArea":"The speed of light will be minimum while passing through\nA) water\tB) vaccum\nC) air\tD) glass"},{"separator":1920},{"textArea":"D) glass"}]}]}
